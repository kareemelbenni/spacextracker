# Rocket Launch Details App

This is a **React Native** app for displaying rocket launch details. It fetches data from a GraphQL API to show a list of rocket launches. You can view more details about each launch by navigating to a separate screen.

## Getting Started

> **Note**: Make sure you have completed the [React Native - Environment Setup](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup) instructions up to the "Creating a new application" step before proceeding.

### Step 1: Start the Metro Server

First, you need to start **Metro**, the JavaScript bundler that ships with React Native.

To start Metro, run the following command from the root of your React Native project:

```bash
# Using npm
npm start

# OR using Yarn
yarn start
```

### Step 2: Start Your Application

Let Metro Bundler run in its own terminal. Open a new terminal and run the following command to start your app:

#### For Android

```bash
# Using npm
npm run android

# OR using Yarn
yarn android
```

#### For iOS

```bash
# Using npm
npm run ios

# OR using Yarn
yarn ios
```

If everything is set up correctly, you should see your app running on your **Android Emulator** or **iOS Simulator**. Make sure that the emulator or simulator is configured correctly.

You can also run the app directly from **Android Studio** or **Xcode**.

### Step 3: Modifying Your App

To modify the app:

1. Open `App.tsx` in your preferred text editor.
2. For **Android**: Press the <kbd>R</kbd> key twice or select **"Reload"** from the **Developer Menu** (<kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>M</kbd> on Windows/Linux, or <kbd>Cmd âŒ˜</kbd> + <kbd>M</kbd> on macOS).
   
   For **iOS**: Press <kbd>Cmd âŒ˜</kbd> + <kbd>R</kbd> in the iOS Simulator to reload the app and see your changes.

### Congratulations! ðŸŽ‰

You've successfully run and modified your React Native app. ðŸŽ‰
